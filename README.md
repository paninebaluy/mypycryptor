# Simple Cryptor

Use it to encrypt and subsequently decrypt strings. 

## Prerequisites

* Python3 is installed.
* This directory is downloaded to your machine.

## Usage

1. Run in the terminal while in the repo directory:

    ```bash
    python3 mycryptor.py
    ```

2. Enter a string.
3. Enter a number from 1 to 3 and remember it. If the number is not in the range, 3 is used by default.
3. Receive output. If you're on Mac, the output is automatically copied to the buffer.
4. Enter or paste the encrypted string.
5. Enter the same number (3 if you used number not in the range before).
6. Receive the initial string back. 

Have a good day.
